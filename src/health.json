      "description": "X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. ... The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways"

Such tests can be divided into several categories, which include (1) concentration and dilution tests, whereby the specific gravity of urine is determined at regular time intervals following water restriction or large water intake, to measure the capacity of the kidneys to conserve water ways"

      "description": "Ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound (ultrasound) waves to produce images of internal organs and other tissues. A device called a transducer converts electrical current into sound waves, which are sent into the bodyâ€™s tissues. Sound waves bounce off structures in the body and are reflected back to the transducer, which converts the waves into electrical signals. A computer converts the pattern of electrical signals into an image, which is displayed on a monitor and recorded as a digital computer image. No x-rays are used, so there is no radiation exposure during an ultrasonography."

The reflected pulses from the skin, brain ventricle, skull, and other head structures are recorded and amplified with a cathode-ray oscilloscope, giving a measure of the distance between the probe and the reflecting surfaces ways"

The usual place for a sample to be taken from is the inside of the elbow or wrist, where the veins are relatively close to the surface."
